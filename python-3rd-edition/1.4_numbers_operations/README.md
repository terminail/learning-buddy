# Numbers and Numeric Operations

## Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you will learn:
- How to work with integers and floats in Python
- Advanced mathematical operations and functions
- Working with different number bases (binary, octal, hexadecimal)
- Using the math module for advanced mathematical functions
- Formatting numbers for display

## Instructions
Complete the TODO sections in [exercise.py](exercise.py) to:
1. Perform advanced mathematical operations
2. Work with different number bases
3. Use the math module for advanced functions
4. Format numbers for display

## Requirements
- Use appropriate variable names that describe their purpose
- Practice different mathematical operations
- Understand how Python handles different number bases
- Use the math module for advanced mathematical functions
- Format numbers for better display

## Getting Started
1. Open [exercise.py](exercise.py)
2. Complete the TODO sections
3. Run your code with `python exercise.py`
4. Run tests with `python run_tests.py` or `python -m pytest test_exercise.py -v`

## Alternative: Interactive Learning
For a better interactive learning experience, we recommend using VS Code with the Jupyter extension:
1. Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install the "Jupyter" and "Python" extensions from the Extensions marketplace
3. Open [1.4_numbers_operations.ipynb](1.4_numbers_operations.ipynb) directly in VS Code
4. Run notebook cells interactively within VS Code
