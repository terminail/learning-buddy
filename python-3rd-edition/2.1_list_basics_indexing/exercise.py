# List Basics and Indexing Exercise
# Working with lists and indexing in Python

# TODO 1: Create a list named 'fruits' with at least 5 different fruit names as strings
# fruits = 

# TODO 2: Create a list named 'numbers' with at least 5 different integers
# numbers = 

# TODO 3: Create a list named 'mixed' with different data types (string, int, float, bool)
# mixed = 

# TODO 4: Access and print the first element of the 'fruits' list
# first_fruit = 

# TODO 5: Access and print the last element of the 'numbers' list using negative indexing
# last_number = 

# TODO 6: Access and print the second element of the 'mixed' list
# second_mixed = 

# TODO 7: Use slicing to get the first three elements of the 'fruits' list
# first_three_fruits = 

# TODO 8: Use slicing to get the last two elements of the 'numbers' list
# last_two_numbers = 

# TODO 9: Use slicing to get elements from index 1 to 3 (not including 3) from the 'mixed' list
# middle_mixed = 

# TODO 10: Find and print the length of each list using the len() function
# fruits_length = 
# numbers_length = 
# mixed_length = 

# TODO 11: Try to access an element that doesn't exist (e.g., index 10 in fruits list)
# What happens when you run this code? (This will cause an IndexError - comment out after testing)
