    "# List Basics and Indexing\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook provides an interactive environment for learning about list basics and indexing in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "1. Follow the TODO comments in the code cells\n",
    "2. Run each cell to see the output\n",
    "3. Use the test cells to verify your implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "This exercise will help you learn:\n",
    "- How to create lists in Python\n",
    "- How to access list elements using indexing\n",
    "- How to use negative indexing\n",
    "- How to slice lists to get sublists\n",
    "- How to find the length of a list\n",
    "- Basic list operations and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "- Use square brackets `[]` to create lists\n",
    "- Access elements using zero-based indexing\n",
    "- Use negative indices to access elements from the end\n",
    "- Apply slicing with `[:]` syntax\n",
    "- Use `len()` function to get list length\n",
    "- Understand that indexing starts at 0 in Python"
