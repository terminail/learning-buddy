# List Basics and Indexing

## Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you will learn:
- How to create lists in Python
- How to access list elements using indexing
- How to use negative indexing
- How to slice lists to get sublists
- How to find the length of a list
- Basic list operations and methods

## Instructions
Complete the TODO sections in [exercise.py](exercise.py) to:
1. Create lists with different types of elements
2. Access list elements using positive and negative indices
3. Use list slicing to extract sublists
4. Find the length of lists
5. Understand how list indexing works in Python

## Requirements
- Use square brackets `[]` to create lists
- Access elements using zero-based indexing
- Use negative indices to access elements from the end
- Apply slicing with `[:]` syntax
- Use `len()` function to get list length
- Understand that indexing starts at 0 in Python

## Getting Started
1. Open [exercise.py](exercise.py)
2. Complete the TODO sections
3. Run your code with `python exercise.py`
4. Run tests with `python run_tests.py` or `python -m pytest test_exercise.py -v`

## Alternative: Interactive Learning
For a better interactive learning experience, we recommend using VS Code with the Jupyter extension:
1. Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install the "Jupyter" and "Python" extensions from the Extensions marketplace
3. Open [2.1_list_basics_indexing.ipynb](2.1_list_basics_indexing.ipynb) directly in VS Code
4. Run notebook cells interactively within VS Code
