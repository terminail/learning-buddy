# Variables and Simple Data Types

## Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you will learn:
- How to create and use variables in Python
- Basic string operations and methods
- String concatenation and formatting
- Working with different data types
- Using both unittest and pytest to verify your code works correctly

## Instructions
Complete the TODO sections in [exercise.py](exercise.py) to:
1. Create variables of different data types (string, integer, float)
2. Perform basic string operations
3. Use string methods to modify text
4. Combine strings using concatenation

## Requirements
- Use appropriate variable names that describe their purpose
- Apply string methods like `.title()`, `.upper()`, and `.lower()`
- Practice string concatenation with `+` operator
- Use f-strings for string formatting (Python 3.6+)
- Write tests using both unittest and pytest to verify your implementation

## Getting Started
1. Open [exercise.py](exercise.py)
2. Complete the TODO sections
3. Run your code with `python exercise.py`
4. Run tests with `python test_exercise.py` (unittest) or `python -m pytest test_exercise_pytest.py -v` (pytest)

## Alternative: Interactive Learning
For a better interactive learning experience, we recommend using VS Code with the Jupyter extension:
1. Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install the "Jupyter" and "Python" extensions from the Extensions marketplace
3. Open [1.1_variables_strings.ipynb](1.1_variables_strings.ipynb) directly in VS Code
4. Run notebook cells interactively within VS Code
