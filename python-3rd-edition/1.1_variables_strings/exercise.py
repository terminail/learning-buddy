# Variables and Simple Data Types Exercise
# Working with variables, strings, and basic data types

# TODO 1: Create a variable named 'name' and assign your name to it as a string
# name = 

# TODO 2: Create a variable named 'age' and assign your age to it as an integer
# age = 

# TODO 3: Create a variable named 'height' and assign your height to it as a float
# height = 

# TODO 4: Print a message using the variables above
# Example: "My name is Alice, I am 25 years old, and I am 5.5 feet tall."

# TODO 5: Create a variable named 'message' and assign a string with your favorite quote
# message = 

# TODO 6: Print the quote in title case, upper case, and lower case
# Use the .title(), .upper(), and .lower() string methods

# TODO 7: Use an f-string to print a formatted message with your variables
# Example: f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
# Assign this to a variable named 'f_string_message'

# TODO 8: Try string concatenation with your name and age
# Example: "My name is " + name + " and I am " + str(age) + " years old."
# Assign this to a variable named 'concatenated_message'
