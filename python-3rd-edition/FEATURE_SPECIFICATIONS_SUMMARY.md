## Key Documents Created

1. **SPECIFICATION_REQUIREMENTS.md** - Defines the requirement to follow chapter order
2. **SPECIFICATION_REQUIREMENTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Explains how the requirement was implemented
3. **ALL_SPECIFICATIONS_COMPLETED.md** - Confirms all specifications are complete
4. **FEATURE_SPECIFICATIONS_SUMMARY.md** - This document summarizing all work
5. **Updated TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md** - References the specification requirements
6. **Updated main spec.md** - Includes all chapters in the features structure

## Verification

All specifications have been verified to:
- ✅ Follow the exact chapter order from the book
- ✅ Maintain proper pedagogical progression
- ✅ Include all required sections in each specification
- ✅ Reference appropriate prerequisites
- ✅ Define comprehensive exercise lists
- ✅ Specify correct tools and technologies
- ✅ Include best practices and assessment methods
- ✅ Follow consistent formatting and structure

## Next Steps

With all feature specifications completed, the next phase involves:
1. Creating exercise directories and files based on the specifications
2. Implementing the exercises following the TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md
3. Creating Jupyter notebook versions of all exercises
4. Testing all exercises to ensure they work correctly
5. Verifying all tests pass with pytest
6. Documenting any additional requirements or updates
