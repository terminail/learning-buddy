# Numbers and Operations

## Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you will learn:
- How to work with integers and floats in Python
- Basic mathematical operations
- Using exponents and order of operations
- Working with large numbers and underscores
- Using built-in functions like abs(), round(), etc.

## Instructions
Complete the TODO sections in [exercise.py](exercise.py) to:
1. Perform basic mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
2. Work with exponents using ** operator
3. Understand the difference between integers and floats
4. Use underscores in large numbers for readability
5. Apply built-in functions like abs(), round(), etc.

## Requirements
- Use appropriate variable names that describe their purpose
- Practice different mathematical operations
- Understand how Python handles integers vs floats
- Use underscores in large numbers for better readability
- Apply built-in mathematical functions

## Getting Started
1. Open [exercise.py](exercise.py)
2. Complete the TODO sections
3. Run your code with `python exercise.py`
4. Run tests with `python test_exercise.py` or `python run_tests.py`

## Alternative: Interactive Learning
For a better interactive learning experience, we recommend using VS Code with the Jupyter extension:
1. Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install the "Jupyter" and "Python" extensions from the Extensions marketplace
3. Open [1.2_numbers_operations.ipynb](1.2_numbers_operations.ipynb) directly in VS Code
4. Run notebook cells interactively within VS Code
