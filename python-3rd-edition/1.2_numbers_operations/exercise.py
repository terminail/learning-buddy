# Numbers and Operations Exercise
# Working with integers, floats, and mathematical operations

# TODO 1: Perform basic mathematical operations
# Create variables for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
# addition = 5 + 3
# subtraction = 10 - 4
# multiplication = 6 * 7
# division = 20 / 4

# TODO 2: Work with exponents
# Calculate 2 to the power of 3 using the ** operator
# power = 2 ** 3

# TODO 3: Understand integers vs floats
# Create examples of integer and float results
# integer_result = 4 / 2  # This will be a float
# float_result = 0.2 + 0.1  # This might surprise you!

# TODO 4: Use underscores in large numbers
# Create a large number using underscores for readability
# universe_age = 14_000_000_000

# TODO 5: Apply built-in functions
# Use abs(), round(), and other mathematical functions
# absolute_value = abs(-10)
# rounded_value = round(3.14159, 2)

# TODO 6: Multiple assignments
# Assign values to multiple variables in one line
# x, y, z = 1, 2, 3

# TODO 7: Constants (by convention)
# Create a constant value (by convention, constants are in ALL_CAPS)
# MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5000
