# Organizing Lists

## Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you will learn:
- How to sort lists permanently with sort() method
- How to sort lists temporarily with sorted() function
- How to reverse the order of lists with reverse() method
- How to find the length of lists with len() function
- How to avoid common indexing errors
- Best practices for organizing list data

## Instructions
Complete the TODO sections in [exercise.py](exercise.py) to:
1. Sort lists in alphabetical and reverse alphabetical order
2. Use sorted() to temporarily sort lists
3. Reverse list order
4. Find list lengths
5. Handle common list indexing errors

## Requirements
- Use sort() method to permanently sort lists
- Apply sorted() function for temporary sorting
- Use reverse() method to reverse list order
- Find list lengths with len() function
- Understand indexing boundaries to avoid errors
- Practice defensive programming techniques

## Getting Started
1. Open [exercise.py](exercise.py)
2. Complete the TODO sections
3. Run your code with `python exercise.py`
4. Run tests with `python run_tests.py` or `python -m pytest test_exercise.py -v`

## Alternative: Interactive Learning
For a better interactive learning experience, we recommend using VS Code with the Jupyter extension:
1. Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install the "Jupyter" and "Python" extensions from the Extensions marketplace
3. Open [2.3_organizing_lists.ipynb](2.3_organizing_lists.ipynb) directly in VS Code
4. Run notebook cells interactively within VS Code
