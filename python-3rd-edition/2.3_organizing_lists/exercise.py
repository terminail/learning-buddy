# Organizing Lists Exercise
# Working with list organization methods in Python

# TODO 1: Create a list named 'places' with at least 5 places you'd like to visit
# places = 

# TODO 2: Print the list in its original order
# print("Original order:")

# TODO 3: Use sorted() to print the list in alphabetical order without modifying the original list
# print("Alphabetical order:")

# TODO 4: Show that the original list is still in its original order
# print("Original order confirmed:")

# TODO 5: Use sorted() to print the list in reverse alphabetical order without modifying the original list
# print("Reverse alphabetical order:")

# TODO 6: Show that the original list is still in its original order
# print("Original order confirmed again:")

# TODO 7: Use reverse() to change the order of the list
# places.reverse()
# print("Reversed order:")

# TODO 8: Use reverse() again to change the order back to the original
# places.reverse()
# print("Back to original order:")

# TODO 9: Use sort() to change the list to alphabetical order
# places.sort()
# print("Sorted alphabetically:")

# TODO 10: Use sort() to change the list to reverse alphabetical order
# places.sort(reverse=True)
# print("Sorted reverse alphabetically:")

# TODO 11: Find and print the length of the 'places' list
# places_length = 

# TODO 12: Try to access an element at an index that doesn't exist
# What happens when you run this code? (This will cause an IndexError - comment out after testing)

# TODO 13: Try to access an element at a negative index that doesn't exist
# What happens when you run this code? (This will cause an IndexError - comment out after testing)
