# Template Update Guide

This guide explains how to update exercise templates when feature specifications change.

## When to Update Templates

Templates should be updated when:
1. Feature specifications are modified
2. New feature specifications are created
3. Industrial tools evolve
4. Pedagogical approaches improve

## Update Process

1. Review changed feature specifications
2. Identify required template modifications
3. Update template files to match new requirements
4. Test template with a sample exercise
5. Document changes in version history

## Feature Specification Integration

When creating exercises based on feature specifications:

1. Review Feature Specification - Read the entire feature spec carefully
2. Identify Learning Objectives - Extract all learning objectives from the spec
3. Map Concepts to TODOs - Create TODO comments for each concept
4. Include Required Visualizations - Add flowcharts when specified
5. Align with Industrial Tools - Ensure pytest and Jupyter integration
6. Follow Assessment Methods - Implement testing as specified
7. Reference Specification - Cite the feature spec in documentation
