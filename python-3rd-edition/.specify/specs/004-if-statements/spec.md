# Feature Specification: If Statements

## Overview
This feature covers conditional statements in Python as presented in Chapter 5 of "Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition". Students will learn how to use if statements to control program flow based on conditions.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this feature, students will be able to:
- Write simple if statements
- Use if-else and if-elif-else chains
- Work with multiple conditions using logical operators
- Check for special values in lists
- Style if statements according to best practices

## Concepts Covered
1. **Conditional Tests**
   - Simple conditional tests
   - Checking for equality and inequality
   - Numerical comparisons
   - Checking multiple conditions

2. **If Statements**
   - Simple if statements
   - If-else statements
   - If-elif-else chains
   - Using multiple elif blocks

3. **Advanced Conditional Logic**
   - Checking whether values are in a list
   - Checking whether a list is empty
   - Styling if statements

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of variables and data types
- Basic knowledge of lists
- Familiarity with boolean values

## Exercises
This feature includes the following exercises:
1. `4.1_conditional_tests` - Writing and testing conditional expressions
2. `4.2_simple_if_statements` - Basic if statement usage
3. `4.3_if_elif_else_chains` - Complex conditional logic with multiple branches
4. `4.4_styling_if_statements` - Best practices for writing clean conditional code

## Tools and Technologies
- Python 3.x
- **pytest** as the sole testing framework for all exercises (replacing traditional unittest)
- **Jupyter notebooks** for interactive learning experiences
- pyproject.toml for dependency management

## Best Practices
- Use clear, descriptive conditions
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for conditional statements
- Avoid complex nested conditions when possible
- Use parentheses for clarity in complex logical expressions
- Test both true and false paths of conditional statements
- Apply proper indentation for readability

## Assessment
Students will be assessed through:
- Automated tests using **pytest** as the exclusive testing framework
- Code review for style and best practices
- Practical exercises that reinforce learning objectives
- **Jupyter notebook** interactive challenges with integrated pytest testing
