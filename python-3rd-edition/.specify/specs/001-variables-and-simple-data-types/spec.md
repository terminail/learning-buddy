# Feature Specification: Variables and Simple Data Types

## Overview
This feature covers the fundamental concepts of variables and simple data types in Python as presented in Chapter 2 of "Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition". Students will learn how to work with variables, strings, numbers, and basic data types in Python.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this feature, students will be able to:
- Create and use variables in Python
- Work with different data types (strings, integers, floats)
- Perform basic string operations and use string methods
- Use string concatenation and formatting (f-strings)
- Write comments in Python code
- Understand and apply naming conventions for variables

## Concepts Covered
1. **Variables**
   - Variable assignment and naming rules
   - Reassigning variable values
   - Best practices for variable naming

2. **Strings**
   - String literals and string variables
   - String methods (`.title()`, `.upper()`, `.lower()`)
   - String concatenation with `+` operator
   - String formatting with f-strings

3. **Numbers**
   - Integers and floating-point numbers
   - Basic mathematical operations (+, -, *, /, **, //, %)
   - Using underscores in large numbers for readability
   - Built-in mathematical functions

4. **Comments**
   - Single-line comments with `#`
   - Multi-line comments (using multiple `#`)
   - Best practices for commenting code

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of what programming is
- No prior programming experience required

## Exercises
This feature includes the following exercises:
1. `1.1_variables_strings` - Working with variables and string operations
2. `1.2_numbers_operations` - Working with numbers and mathematical operations
3. `1.3_strings_methods` - Advanced string methods and operations
4. `1.4_numbers_operations` - Advanced number operations and mathematical functions
5. `1.5_comments_documentation` - Writing effective comments and documentation

## Tools and Technologies
- Python 3.x
- **pytest** as the sole testing framework for all exercises (replacing traditional unittest)
- **Jupyter notebooks** for interactive learning experiences
- pyproject.toml for dependency management

## Best Practices
- Use descriptive variable names that follow Python naming conventions
- Apply PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Write clear, meaningful comments that explain "why" not just "what"
- Use f-strings for string formatting (Python 3.6+)
- Follow the principle of "one concept at a time" for progressive learning

## Assessment
Students will be assessed through:
- Automated tests using **pytest** as the exclusive testing framework
- Code review for style and best practices
- Practical exercises that reinforce learning objectives
- **Jupyter notebook** interactive challenges with integrated pytest testing
