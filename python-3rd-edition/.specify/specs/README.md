# Python Crash Course Specifications

This directory contains the feature specifications for learning Python based on "Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition" by Eric Matthes. Each feature is organized in a numbered directory following the spec-kit规范.

## Structure
- `spec.md` - Main specification document outlining the complete learning path
- `001-variables-and-simple-data-types/` - Feature specification for Chapter 2
- `002-lists/` - Feature specification for Chapter 3
- `003-working-with-lists/` - Feature specification for Chapter 4
- `004-if-statements/` - Feature specification for Chapter 5
- `005-dictionaries/` - Feature specification for Chapter 6

## Purpose
These specifications define:
- Learning objectives for each feature
- Concepts covered in each chapter
- Prerequisites for each feature
- Exercises included in each feature
- **Industrial tools and technologies used (pytest for testing, Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning)**
- Best practices and assessment methods

## Template Guide
All exercises must be developed following the TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md specification to ensure consistency and alignment with feature requirements.

## Usage
Each feature specification serves as a blueprint for creating educational content, exercises, and assessments that align with the learning objectives of the Python Crash Course book while following modern pedagogical principles. All exercises must follow the TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md specification.
