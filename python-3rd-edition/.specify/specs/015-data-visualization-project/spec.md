# Feature Specification: Data Visualization Project

## Overview
This feature covers the Data Visualization project as presented in Chapter 13 of "Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition". Students will learn how to create charts and graphs using Matplotlib and work with data from various sources.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this feature, students will be able to:
- Install and use the Matplotlib library
- Create various types of charts and graphs
- Customize chart appearance and styling
- Work with data from lists, files, and APIs
- Create scatter plots and line graphs
- Generate random walks and visualize them
- Apply styling guidelines for data visualization

## Concepts Covered
1. **Installing and Setting Up Matplotlib**
   - Installing Matplotlib with pip
   - Creating simple line graphs
   - Plotting and styling individual points
   - Using scatter() for scatter plots
   - Customizing colors and point sizes
   - Saving plots to files

2. **Creating Different Types of Charts**
   - Line graphs for continuous data
   - Scatter plots for relationships between variables
   - Bar charts for categorical data
   - Histograms for frequency distributions
   - Pie charts for proportional data
   - Multiple plots in one figure

3. **Customizing Charts**
   - Setting chart titles and axis labels
   - Changing line styles, colors, and markers
   - Adding legends and annotations
   - Setting axis ranges and tick marks
   - Using built-in styles for professional appearance
   - Creating custom color schemes

4. **Working with Data**
   - Plotting data from lists
   - Reading data from CSV files
   - Working with datetime data
   - Calculating and plotting statistical measures
   - Handling missing or invalid data
   - Generating sample data for testing

5. **Random Walks Visualization**
   - Creating RandomWalk class
   - Generating random walks with varying steps
   - Visualizing random walks with scatter plots
   - Styling random walk visualizations
   - Creating multiple random walks
   - Analyzing random walk patterns

6. **Data Visualization Styling Guidelines**
   - Choosing appropriate chart types for data
   - Following best practices for chart design
   - Making charts accessible and readable
   - Using color effectively
   - Adding context and explanations
   - Exporting charts in different formats

## Prerequisites
- Understanding of functions (Chapter 8)
- Knowledge of classes (Chapter 9)
- Understanding of files and exceptions (Chapter 10)
- Basic understanding of testing (Chapter 11)
- Experience with conditional statements and loops (Chapters 5 and 7)

## Exercises
This feature includes the following exercises:
1. `13.1_setting_up_matplotlib` - Installing Matplotlib and creating basic plots
2. `13.2_customizing_charts` - Styling and customizing chart appearance
3. `13.3_working_with_data` - Plotting data from lists and files
4. `13.4_scatter_plots` - Creating scatter plots and analyzing relationships
5. `13.5_random_walks` - Generating and visualizing random walks
6. `13.6_data_visualization_styling` - Applying best practices for chart design

## Tools and Technologies
- Python 3.x
- Matplotlib library for data visualization
- **pytest** for testing visualization components
- **Jupyter notebooks** for interactive learning experiences
- pyproject.toml for dependency management
- CSV module for reading data files

## Best Practices
- Choose the right chart type for your data
- Keep charts clean and uncluttered
- Use appropriate scales and axis ranges
- Label axes and provide titles
- Use color effectively but avoid overuse
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Test visualization code with sample data
- Document visualization functions clearly

## Assessment
Students will be assessed through:
- Automated tests using **pytest** for visualization components
- Code review for style and best practices
- Practical exercises that reinforce learning objectives
- **Jupyter notebook** interactive challenges with integrated pytest testing
- Evaluation of created visualizations for clarity and effectiveness
