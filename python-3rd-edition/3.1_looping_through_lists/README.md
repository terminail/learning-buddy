# Looping Through Lists

## Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you will learn:
- How to loop through lists using for loops
- How to use the range() function with lists
- How to use enumerate() to get both index and value
- How to create numerical lists with range()
- How to use list comprehensions
- Best practices for iterating through lists
- **How to visualize loop execution flow using flowcharts**

## Instructions
Complete the TODO sections in [exercise.py](exercise.py) to:
1. Loop through lists using for loops
2. Use range() function with lists
3. Use enumerate() to get index and value
4. Create numerical lists with range()
5. Practice list comprehension techniques

## Requirements
- Use for loops to iterate through list elements
- Apply range() function with len() for index-based iteration
- Use enumerate() function to get both index and value
- Create numerical lists using range() function
- Understand list comprehension syntax
- Follow Python best practices for looping
- **Visualize and understand loop execution flow using flowchart representations**

## Getting Started
1. Open [exercise.py](exercise.py)
2. Complete the TODO sections
3. Run your code with `python exercise.py`
4. Run tests with `python run_tests.py` or `python -m pytest test_exercise.py -v`

## Alternative: Interactive Learning
For a better interactive learning experience, we recommend using VS Code with the Jupyter extension:
1. Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install the "Jupyter" and "Python" extensions from the Extensions marketplace
3. Open [3.1_looping_through_lists.ipynb](3.1_looping_through_lists.ipynb) directly in VS Code
4. Run notebook cells interactively within VS Code
