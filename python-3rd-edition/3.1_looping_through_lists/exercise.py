# Looping Through Lists Exercise
# Working with list iteration methods in Python

# TODO 1: Create a list named 'fruits' with at least 4 fruit names
# fruits = 

# TODO 2: Use a for loop to print each fruit in the list
# for fruit in fruits:
#     # Print each fruit
#
# Flowchart visualization:
# Start -> Get first element -> Process element -> Check: More elements? -> True -> Get next element -> Process element -> ...
#                                    |
#                                    | False
#                                    ▼
#                                  End

# TODO 3: Create a list named 'numbers' with integers from 1 to 5
# numbers = 

# TODO 4: Use a for loop with range() and len() to print each number with its index
# for i in range(len(numbers)):
#     # Print index and value
#
# Flowchart visualization:
# Start -> i = 0 -> Check: i < len(numbers)? -> True -> Process numbers[i] -> i += 1 -> Check: i < len(numbers)? -> ...
#                                       |
#                                       | False
#                                       ▼
#                                     End

# TODO 5: Use enumerate() to print each number with its index
# for index, value in enumerate(numbers):
#     # Print index and value
#
# Flowchart visualization:
# Start -> Get first (index, value) pair -> Process pair -> Check: More elements? -> True -> Get next (index, value) pair -> ...
#                                                    |
#                                                    | False
#                                                    ▼
#                                                  End

# TODO 6: Create a list of squares using list comprehension
# squares = 

# TODO 7: Use list comprehension to create a list of uppercase fruits
# uppercase_fruits = 

# TODO 8: Use a for loop to print a message for each fruit
# for fruit in fruits:
#     # Print a message like "I like apples"

# TODO 9: Use a for loop to calculate the sum of the numbers list
# total = 0
# for number in numbers:
#     # Add each number to total
# sum_result = total

# TODO 10: Use list comprehension to filter fruits that start with a vowel
# vowel_fruits =
