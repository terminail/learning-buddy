# Strings and String Methods

## Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you will learn:
- How to work with strings in Python
- Common string methods like `.strip()`, `.lstrip()`, `.rstrip()`
- How to use `.removeprefix()` and `.removesuffix()`
- String searching methods like `.find()` and `.count()`
- How to replace parts of strings with `.replace()`

## Instructions
Complete the TODO sections in [exercise.py](exercise.py) to:
1. Create strings with extra whitespace
2. Use stripping methods to clean up whitespace
3. Use prefix/suffix removal methods
4. Search for substrings in strings
5. Replace parts of strings

## Requirements
- Use appropriate variable names that describe their purpose
- Apply string methods like `.strip()`, `.lstrip()`, `.rstrip()`
- Practice using `.removeprefix()` and `.removesuffix()`
- Use `.find()` and `.count()` to search strings
- Apply `.replace()` to modify strings

## Getting Started
1. Open [exercise.py](exercise.py)
2. Complete the TODO sections
3. Run your code with `python exercise.py`
4. Run tests with `python run_tests.py` or `python -m pytest test_exercise.py -v`

## Alternative: Interactive Learning
For a better interactive learning experience, we recommend using VS Code with the Jupyter extension:
1. Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install the "Jupyter" and "Python" extensions from the Extensions marketplace
3. Open [1.3_strings_methods.ipynb](1.3_strings_methods.ipynb) directly in VS Code
4. Run notebook cells interactively within VS Code
