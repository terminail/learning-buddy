# Comments and Documentation

## Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you will learn:
- How to write comments in Python using the `#` symbol
- The difference between single-line and multi-line comments
- How to write docstrings for functions and modules
- Best practices for commenting your code
- How to use comments effectively for code documentation

## Instructions
Complete the TODO sections in [exercise.py](exercise.py) to:
1. Write single-line comments to explain code
2. Write multi-line comments for longer explanations
3. Create docstrings for functions
4. Add inline comments for complex operations
5. Practice writing clear, meaningful comments

## Requirements
- Use `#` for single-line comments
- Use `#` with multiple lines for multi-line comments (Python doesn't have /* */ style comments)
- Write docstrings using triple quotes (`"""` or `'''`)
- Follow PEP 257 conventions for docstrings
- Write comments that explain "why" not just "what"
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

## Getting Started
1. Open [exercise.py](exercise.py)
2. Complete the TODO sections
3. Run your code with `python exercise.py`
4. Run tests with `python run_tests.py` or `python -m pytest test_exercise.py -v`

## Alternative: Interactive Learning
For a better interactive learning experience, we recommend using VS Code with the Jupyter extension:
1. Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install the "Jupyter" and "Python" extensions from the Extensions marketplace
3. Open [1.5_comments_documentation.ipynb](1.5_comments_documentation.ipynb) directly in VS Code
4. Run notebook cells interactively within VS Code
