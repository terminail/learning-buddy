# Specification Requirements for Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition

This document outlines the requirements for creating specifications that align with "Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming" by Eric Matthes. All specifications must be created following the chapter order of this book to ensure proper progression and learning outcomes.

## Chapter Order Requirement

All specifications must be created following the exact chapter order of "Python Crash Course, 3rd Edition". This ensures:

1. **Proper Learning Progression**: Concepts are introduced in a logical sequence that builds upon previous knowledge
2. **Consistent Difficulty Curve**: Each specification introduces appropriate complexity based on prior chapters
3. **Pedagogical Alignment**: Maintains the book's proven teaching approach and methodology
4. **Prerequisite Management**: Ensures all required foundational knowledge is established before advancing

## Required Chapter Sequence

Specifications must be developed in this exact order:

1. **Chapter 1**: Getting Started
2. **Chapter 2**: Variables and Simple Data Types
3. **Chapter 3**: Introducing Lists
4. **Chapter 4**: Working with Lists
5. **Chapter 5**: If Statements
6. **Chapter 6**: Dictionaries
7. **Chapter 7**: User Input and While Loops
8. **Chapter 8**: Functions
9. **Chapter 9**: Classes
10. **Chapter 10**: Files and Exceptions
11. **Chapter 11**: Testing Your Code
12. **Chapter 12**: Projects (Alien Invasion Game)
13. **Chapter 13**: Projects (Data Visualization)
14. **Chapter 14**: Projects (Web Applications)

## Specification Development Process

When creating specifications for each chapter:

1. **Complete Previous Chapters First**: Ensure all specifications for preceding chapters are finalized
2. **Reference Learning Objectives**: Align specifications with the book's stated learning objectives for each chapter
3. **Maintain Conceptual Dependencies**: Verify that new specifications don't assume knowledge from future chapters
4. **Progressive Complexity**: Each chapter's specifications should build incrementally on previous concepts
5. **Consistent Structure**: Follow the established TEMPLATE_GUIDE.md for all specifications

## Exception Handling

If a chapter requires concepts from a later chapter (forward references):
1. Document the dependency clearly in the specification
2. Create placeholder specifications for the prerequisite chapter if needed
3. Note any deviations from the standard progression in the specification documentation

## Review Process

All specifications must be reviewed to ensure:
1. **Sequential Compliance**: Specifications follow the correct chapter order
2. **Conceptual Integrity**: No forward references without proper documentation
3. **Progressive Difficulty**: Each specification appropriately builds on previous ones
4. **Alignment with Source Material**: Specifications accurately reflect the book's content and approach

## Updates and Maintenance

When the book edition is updated or new chapters are added:
1. Review existing specifications for any ordering changes
2. Update this document to reflect the new chapter sequence
3. Adjust existing specifications as needed to maintain proper progression
4. Document all changes in the version history
