# Avoiding Index Errors

## Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you will learn:
- How to identify and handle IndexError exceptions
- How to use len() to avoid index errors
- How to use try-except blocks to handle index errors gracefully
- How to validate list indices before accessing elements
- Best practices for safe list access
- How to debug common list indexing issues

## Instructions
Complete the TODO sections in [exercise.py](exercise.py) to:
1. Identify common causes of index errors
2. Use len() to check list boundaries
3. Implement try-except blocks for error handling
4. Validate indices before accessing list elements
5. Practice defensive programming techniques

## Requirements
- Understand that list indices start at 0 and go to len(list) - 1
- Use len() function to check list boundaries
- Apply try-except blocks to handle IndexError exceptions
- Validate indices before accessing list elements
- Use defensive programming to prevent crashes
- Debug and fix common indexing issues

## Getting Started
1. Open [exercise.py](exercise.py)
2. Complete the TODO sections
3. Run your code with `python exercise.py`
4. Run tests with `python run_tests.py` or `python -m pytest test_exercise.py -v`

## Alternative: Interactive Learning
For a better interactive learning experience, we recommend using VS Code with the Jupyter extension:
1. Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install the "Jupyter" and "Python" extensions from the Extensions marketplace
3. Open [2.4_avoiding_index_errors.ipynb](2.4_avoiding_index_errors.ipynb) directly in VS Code
4. Run notebook cells interactively within VS Code
