# Python Exercise Solution Template
# Complete reference solution for the exercise

# Example implementation (replace with exercise-specific solution):
name = "Alice"
age = 25
message = f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."

print(message.title())
print(message.upper())
print(message.lower())

# Additional implementation as required by the exercise
# When working with loops, include flowchart explanation comments:
# Flowchart explanation:
# This loop follows the pattern: initialization -> condition check -> process -> update -> condition check -> ...
# The loop terminates when the condition evaluates to False

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Test code to verify the implementation
    print("Solution executed successfully!")
