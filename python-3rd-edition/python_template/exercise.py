# Python Exercise Template
# Incomplete code with TODO comments for students to complete

# TODO 1: Create variables as specified in the exercise requirements
# Example:
# name = "Alice"
# age = 25

# TODO 2: Perform operations as specified in the exercise requirements
# Example:
# message = f"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old."

# TODO 3: Use appropriate string methods as specified in the exercise requirements
# Example:
# print(message.title())
# print(message.upper())
# print(message.lower())

# TODO 4: Implement any additional requirements specified in the exercise
# When working with loops, include flowchart visualization comments:
# Flowchart visualization:
# Start -> [initialization] -> Check: [condition]? -> True -> [process] -> [update] -> Check: [condition]? -> ...
#                                              |
#                                              | False
#                                              ▼
#                                            End
