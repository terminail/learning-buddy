# Modifying Lists

## Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you will learn:
- How to modify list elements by index
- How to add elements to lists using append(), insert(), and extend()
- How to remove elements from lists using remove(), pop(), and del
- How to sort lists using sort() and sorted()
- How to reverse lists using reverse()
- How to copy lists and avoid common pitfalls

## Instructions
Complete the TODO sections in [exercise.py](exercise.py) to:
1. Modify existing list elements
2. Add new elements to lists using different methods
3. Remove elements from lists using different methods
4. Sort and reverse lists
5. Copy lists correctly

## Requirements
- Use indexing to modify specific list elements
- Apply list methods like append(), insert(), extend()
- Use remove(), pop(), and del to remove elements
- Sort lists with sort() and sorted()
- Reverse lists with reverse()
- Understand the difference between shallow and deep copying

## Getting Started
1. Open [exercise.py](exercise.py)
2. Complete the TODO sections
3. Run your code with `python exercise.py`
4. Run tests with `python run_tests.py` or `python -m pytest test_exercise.py -v`

## Alternative: Interactive Learning
For a better interactive learning experience, we recommend using VS Code with the Jupyter extension:
1. Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install the "Jupyter" and "Python" extensions from the Extensions marketplace
3. Open [2.2_modifying_lists.ipynb](2.2_modifying_lists.ipynb) directly in VS Code
4. Run notebook cells interactively within VS Code
