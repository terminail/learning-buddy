# Indentation and Code Styling

## Learning Objectives
In this exercise, you will learn:
- How to properly indent Python code
- Common indentation errors and how to fix them
- Best practices for code styling in loops
- How to follow PEP 8 compliance for indentation

## Instructions
Complete the TODO sections in [exercise.py](exercise.py) to:
1. Practice proper Python indentation (4 spaces per level)
2. Identify and fix common indentation errors
3. Apply best practices for code styling in loops
4. Ensure PEP 8 compliance for indentation

## Requirements
- Use 4 spaces for each level of indentation (not tabs)
- Keep lines under 79 characters when possible
- Use blank lines to separate logical sections of code
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Apply proper error handling for edge cases

## Getting Started
1. Open [exercise.py](exercise.py)
2. Complete the TODO sections
3. Run your code with `python exercise.py`
4. Run tests with `python run_tests.py` or `python -m pytest test_exercise.py -v`

## Alternative: Interactive Learning
For a better interactive learning experience, we recommend using VS Code with the Jupyter extension:
1. Install VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/
2. Install the "Jupyter" and "Python" extensions from the Extensions marketplace
3. Open [3.2_indentation_styling.ipynb](3.2_indentation_styling.ipynb) directly in VS Code
4. Run notebook cells interactively within VS Code
