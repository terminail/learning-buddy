# Chapter 4.1: Expressions and Statements

This directory contains exercises for learning about expressions and statements in C++ as covered in C++ Primer 5th Edition.

## Exercise Structure

### 4.1.1: Arithmetic Operators
**Directory**: [arithmetic_operators](arithmetic_operators/)
Basic arithmetic operations and operator behavior including +, -, *, /, %, unary operators, and precedence.

### 4.1.2: Relational Operators
**Directory**: [relational_operators](relational_operators/)
Comparison operations including equality operators (==, !=) and relational operators (<, >, <=, >=).

### 4.1.3: Logical Operators
**Directory**: [logical_operators](logical_operators/)
Logical operations including AND (&&), OR (||), NOT (!), short-circuit evaluation, and precedence.

### 4.1.4: Operator Precedence and Associativity
**Directory**: [operator_precedence](operator_precedence/)
Understanding complex expression evaluation including precedence rules, associativity, and parentheses usage.

## Learning Progression

Complete the exercises in numerical order:
1. [arithmetic_operators](arithmetic_operators/) - Fundamental arithmetic operations
2. [relational_operators](relational_operators/) - Comparison operations
3. [logical_operators](logical_operators/) - Logical operations
4. [operator_precedence](operator_precedence/) - Complex expression evaluation

## Getting Started

Each exercise directory contains:
- `src/` - Source code files (exercise and solution)
- `test/` - Unit tests
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Build configuration
- `README.md` - Exercise-specific documentation
- `build.sh` - Build script for Linux/Docker
- `run_tests.sh` - Test execution script

## Prerequisites

These exercises build upon knowledge from:
- Chapter 3.3: Array and String Algorithms
- Basic control flow concepts

## Next Steps

After completing these exercises, continue with:
- Chapter 5: Statements
- Chapter 6: Functions
