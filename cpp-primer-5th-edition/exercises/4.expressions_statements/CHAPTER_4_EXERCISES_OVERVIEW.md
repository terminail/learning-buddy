# Expressions and Statements Exercises Overview

This document provides an overview of all expressions and statements exercises created for learning C++ Primer 5th Edition concepts.

## Exercise Progression

### 4.1.1: Arithmetic Operators
**Directory**: [arithmetic_operators](arithmetic_operators/)
**Focus**: Basic arithmetic operations and operator behavior
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus
- Unary plus and minus operators
- Integer vs floating-point arithmetic
- Operator precedence with arithmetic operators

### 4.1.2: Relational Operators
**Directory**: [relational_operators](relational_operators/)
**Focus**: Comparison operations and their behavior
- Equality operators (==, !=)
- Relational operators (<, >, <=, >=)
- Character and string comparisons
- Mixed-type comparisons

### 4.1.3: Logical Operators
**Directory**: [logical_operators](logical_operators/)
**Focus**: Logical operations and short-circuit evaluation
- Logical AND (&&), OR (||), and NOT (!)
- Short-circuit evaluation behavior
- Operator precedence with logical operators
- De Morgan's laws

### 4.1.4: Operator Precedence and Associativity
**Directory**: [operator_precedence](operator_precedence/)
**Focus**: Understanding complex expression evaluation
- Precedence rules for mixed operator expressions
- Associativity rules (left-to-right vs right-to-left)
- Using parentheses to control evaluation order
- Complex expressions with multiple operator types

## Learning Path

Students should complete these exercises in order:
1. **Arithmetic Operators** - Start with fundamental arithmetic operations
2. **Relational Operators** - Move to comparison operations
3. **Logical Operators** - Combine conditions with logical operations
4. **Operator Precedence** - Understand complex expression evaluation

## Key Concepts Covered

### Arithmetic Operations
- **Basic Operators**: +, -, *, /, %
- **Unary Operators**: +, -
- **Type Considerations**: Integer vs floating-point behavior
- **Precedence**: Multiplication and division before addition and subtraction

### Comparison Operations
- **Equality**: ==, !=
- **Relational**: <, >, <=, >=
- **Lexicographical Ordering**: String comparisons
- **Mixed Types**: Implicit conversions in comparisons

### Logical Operations
- **AND, OR, NOT**: &&, ||, !
- **Short-Circuit Evaluation**: Performance and safety benefits
- **Precedence**: !, then &&, then ||
- **De Morgan's Laws**: Simplifying complex logical expressions

### Expression Evaluation
- **Operator Precedence**: Complete precedence hierarchy
- **Associativity**: Left-to-right for most operators
- **Parentheses**: Overriding natural precedence
- **Complex Expressions**: Combining multiple operator types
