# Exercise 10.1b: Transform and Copy Algorithms

This directory contains exercises for learning about transform and copy algorithms in C++ STL as covered in C++ Primer 5th Edition.

## Exercise Structure

### Transform and Copy Algorithms
**Directory**: [src/](src/)

## Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, students will understand:
- How to use std::transform to modify elements in containers
- How to use std::copy to copy elements between containers
- How to use std::copy_if to copy only elements meeting conditions
- How to use std::replace and std::replace_if to modify elements
- How to work with these algorithms on different container types
- Best practices for transforming and copying container elements

## Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with:
- Basic C++ syntax
- STL containers (vector, list, etc.)
- Iterators
- Lambda expressions
- Basic understanding of templates

## Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the exercise
