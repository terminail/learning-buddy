# Exercise 10.1c: Sort and Merge Algorithms

This directory contains exercises for learning about sort and merge algorithms in C++ STL as covered in C++ Primer 5th Edition.

## Exercise Structure

### Sort and Merge Algorithms
**Directory**: [src/](src/)

## Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, students will understand:
- How to use std::sort to sort containers in different orders
- How to use std::stable_sort to maintain relative order of equivalent elements
- How to sort containers of custom objects with custom comparators
- How to use std::merge to combine sorted sequences
- How to use std::inplace_merge to merge adjacent sorted sequences
- Best practices for sorting and merging container elements

## Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with:
- Basic C++ syntax
- STL containers (vector, list, etc.)
- Iterators
- Lambda expressions
- Basic understanding of templates
- Comparison functions and operators

## Building and Testing
