# Exercise 10.1d: Numeric Algorithms

This directory contains exercises for learning about numeric algorithms in C++ STL as covered in C++ Primer 5th Edition.

## Exercise Structure

### Numeric Algorithms
**Directory**: [src/](src/)

## Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, students will understand:
- How to use std::accumulate to perform operations on container elements
- How to use std::inner_product to calculate dot products
- How to use std::partial_sum to calculate cumulative operations
- How to use std::adjacent_difference to calculate differences between adjacent elements
- How to work with these algorithms on different container types
- How to use custom binary operations with numeric algorithms
- Best practices for numeric computations with STL containers

## Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with:
- Basic C++ syntax
- STL containers (vector, list, etc.)
- Iterators
- Lambda expressions
- Basic understanding of templates
- Mathematical concepts (sum, product, dot product, etc.)
