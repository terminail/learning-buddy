# Chapter 8.1: IO Library

This directory contains exercises for learning about the IO library in C++ as covered in C++ Primer 5th Edition.

## Exercise Structure

### 8.1a: Basic IO Operations
**Directory**: [basic_io](basic_io/)
Introduction to basic input/output operations including console and file I/O.

### 8.1b: Stream States and Error Handling
**Directory**: [stream_states](stream_states/)
Working with stream state flags and implementing proper error handling.

### 8.1c: File Streams
**Directory**: [file_streams](file_streams/)
Working with file input/output operations and binary files.

### 8.1d: Output Formatting
**Directory**: [output_formatting](output_formatting/)
Formatting output with stream manipulators and creating professional reports.

## Learning Progression

Complete the exercises in numerical order:
1. [basic_io](basic_io/) - Fundamental IO operations
2. [stream_states](stream_states/) - Stream state management and error handling
3. [file_streams](file_streams/) - File input/output operations
4. [output_formatting](output_formatting/) - Output formatting and manipulation

## Getting Started

Each exercise directory contains:
- `src/` - Source code files (exercise and solution)
- `test/` - Unit tests
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Build configuration
- `README.md` - Exercise-specific documentation
- `build.sh` - Build script for Linux/Docker
- `run_tests.sh` - Test execution script

## Prerequisites

These exercises build upon knowledge from:
- Chapter 7: Classes
- Basic file operations

## Next Steps

After completing these exercises, continue with:
- More advanced IO library concepts
- Chapter 9: Sequential Containers
