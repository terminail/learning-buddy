# Chapter 19: Specialized Tools and Techniques Exercises Overview

This directory contains exercises for Chapter 19 of C++ Primer 5th Edition, which covers specialized tools and techniques in C++.

## Exercise Progression

### 19.1a: Run-Time Type Identification (RTTI)
**Directory**: [rtti](rtti/)
**Focus**: Runtime type information and safe casting
- Using typeid operator for type identification
- Using dynamic_cast for safe downcasting
- Comparing type information at runtime
- Implementing type-safe containers

### 19.1b: Multiple Inheritance
**Directory**: [multiple_inheritance](multiple_inheritance/)
**Focus**: Inheriting from multiple base classes
- Basic multiple inheritance
- Virtual inheritance to solve the diamond problem
- Mixins and interface combination
- Best practices for multiple inheritance

## Learning Path

Students should complete these exercises in order:
1. **RTTI** - Start with runtime type identification concepts
2. **Multiple Inheritance** - Learn about inheriting from multiple base classes

## Key Concepts Covered

### RTTI (Run-Time Type Identification)
- **typeid Operator**: Getting type information at runtime
- **dynamic_cast**: Safe downcasting in inheritance hierarchies
- **Type Comparison**: Comparing types at runtime
- **Performance Implications**: Understanding RTTI overhead
- **Best Practices**: When and how to use RTTI effectively

### Multiple Inheritance
- **Basic Multiple Inheritance**: Inheriting from multiple base classes
- **Virtual Inheritance**: Solving the diamond problem
- **Mixin Classes**: Small classes that provide specific functionality
- **Interface Combination**: Combining multiple interfaces
- **Design Considerations**: Weighing multiple inheritance vs composition

## Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with:
- Basic C++ syntax and data types
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Virtual functions
- Pointers and references
