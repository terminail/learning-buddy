# Map Basics Exercise

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to create and use std::map containers
- Learn different methods to insert key-value pairs into a map
- Practice accessing values using keys
- Iterate through map containers to process all elements

## Topics Covered
- Map declaration and initialization
- Element insertion using [] operator and insert() method
- Element access using [] and at() methods
- Range-based for loops with maps
- Key-value pair iteration

## Instructions
1. Implement the TODO comments in [map_basics_exercises.cpp](src/map_basics_exercises.cpp)
2. Build and run your solution using the provided build scripts
3. Compare your implementation with the solution in [map_basics_solutions.cpp](src/map_basics_solutions.cpp)

## Expected Output
When running the solution, you should see output similar to:
```
Apple count: 3
Banana count: 5
All word counts:
apple: 3
banana: 5
grape: 7
orange: 2
```

Note that the order of elements in the map is sorted by keys automatically.
