# Set Basics Exercise

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to create and use std::set containers
- Learn methods to insert elements into a set
- Practice checking for element existence
- Iterate through set containers to process all elements

## Topics Covered
- Set declaration and initialization
- Element insertion using insert() method
- Element lookup using count() and find() methods
- Range-based for loops with sets
- Automatic sorting and uniqueness properties of sets

## Instructions
1. Implement the TODO comments in [set_basics_exercises.cpp](src/set_basics_exercises.cpp)
2. Build and run your solution using the provided build scripts
3. Compare your implementation with the solution in [set_basics_solutions.cpp](src/set_basics_solutions.cpp)

## Expected Output
When running the solution, you should see output similar to:
```
Found apple in the set
Grape not found in the set
Unique words in the set:
apple
banana
orange
Total unique words: 3
```

Note that:
1. Duplicate elements are automatically ignored
2. Elements are automatically sorted (alphabetically for strings)
