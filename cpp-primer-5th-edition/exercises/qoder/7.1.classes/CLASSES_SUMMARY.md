# Classes Exercises Summary

This document provides an overview of all classes exercises created for learning C++ Primer 5th Edition concepts.

## Exercise Progression

### 7.1a: Class Basics
**Directory**: [class_basics](class_basics/)
**Focus**: Introduction to classes in C++
- Class definition syntax
- Data members and member functions
- Access specifiers (public, private)
- Constructors and initialization
- Getter and setter functions

## Learning Path

Students should complete these exercises in order:
1. **Class Basics** - Start with fundamental class concepts

## Key Concepts Covered

### Class Definition
- **Class Keyword**: Using `class` to define new types
- **Access Specifiers**: `public` and `private` member access control
- **Data Members**: Variables that belong to a class
- **Member Functions**: Functions that operate on class data

### Constructors
- **Default Constructor**: Constructor with no parameters
- **Parameterized Constructor**: Constructor that takes parameters
- **Constructor Initialization**: Using member initializer lists
- **Object Creation**: Creating objects using constructors

### Encapsulation
- **Data Hiding**: Using private members to hide implementation details
- **Getter Functions**: Public functions to access private data
- **Setter Functions**: Public functions to modify private data
- **Const Correctness**: Using `const` for functions that don't modify data

### Object Usage
- **Object Creation**: Creating instances of classes
- **Member Access**: Using dot notation to access members
- **Function Calls**: Calling member functions on objects
- **Object Lifetime**: Understanding object construction and destruction
