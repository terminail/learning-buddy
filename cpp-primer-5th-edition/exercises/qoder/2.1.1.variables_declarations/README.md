# Exercise 2.1.1: Variable Declarations and Basic Types

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to declare variables in C++
- Learn about basic data types: int, double, char, bool, and std::string
- Practice declaring variables without initialization

## Concepts Covered
- Variable declarations
- Basic data types in C++
- Difference between declaration and initialization

## Instructions
1. Open `src/variables_declarations_exercises.cpp`
2. Follow the TODO comments to declare variables of different types
3. Compile and run your program to verify it works correctly
4. Compare your solution with `src/variables_declarations_solutions.cpp`

## Expected Output
```
Variables declared successfully!
```

## Key Points to Remember
- Declaration creates a variable but doesn't give it a value
- Initialization gives a variable its initial value
- Different types store different kinds of data:
  - `int` for integers (whole numbers)
  - `double` for floating-point numbers (numbers with decimal points)
  - `char` for single characters
  - `bool` for true/false values
  - `std::string` for text strings

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Forgetting to include the `<string>` header when using `std::string`
- Confusing declaration with initialization
- Using incorrect syntax for character literals (use single quotes for char)

## Next Steps
