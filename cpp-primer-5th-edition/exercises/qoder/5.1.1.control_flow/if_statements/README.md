# Exercise 5.1.1: If Statements

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use if statements for decision making
- Learn about if/else if/else constructs
- Practice writing conditional expressions
- Implement programs that make decisions based on input

## Concepts Covered
- Basic if statements
- if/else statements
- if/else if/else chains
- Comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
- Logical flow control

## Instructions
1. Open `src/if_statements_exercises.cpp`
2. Follow the TODO comments to implement the three programs
3. Compile and run your program to verify it works correctly
4. Compare your solution with `src/if_statements_solutions.cpp`

## Expected Output
Example output when running the solution:
```
Enter a number: 5
5 is positive.
Enter your age: 17
You are not eligible to vote.
Enter two numbers: 10 7
10 is larger than 7
```

## Key Points to Remember
- **if statement**: Executes code only if a condition is true
- **if/else statement**: Executes one block if true, another if false
- **if/else if/else chain**: Checks multiple conditions in sequence
- **Comparison operators**: Used to compare values in conditions
- **Indentation**: Helps visualize the structure of conditional code

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Forgetting to use curly braces {} for multi-line blocks
- Using = instead of == for comparison
- Not handling all possible cases in an if/else chain
- Incorrect logical conditions

## Next Steps
