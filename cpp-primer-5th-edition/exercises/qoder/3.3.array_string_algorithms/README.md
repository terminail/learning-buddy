# Chapter 3.3: Array and String Algorithms

This directory contains exercises for learning about array and string algorithms in C++ as covered in C++ Primer 5th Edition.

## Exercise Structure

### 3.3a: Algorithms Practice
**Directory**: [algorithms_practice](algorithms_practice/)
Introduction to common STL algorithms used with arrays and strings.

## Learning Progression

Complete the exercises in numerical order:
1. [algorithms_practice](algorithms_practice/) - Fundamental array and string algorithms

## Getting Started

Each exercise directory contains:
- `src/` - Source code files (exercise and solution)
- `test/` - Unit tests
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Build configuration
- `README.md` - Exercise-specific documentation
- `build.sh` - Build script for Linux/Docker
- `test_runner.sh` - Test execution script

## Prerequisites

These exercises build upon knowledge from:
- Chapter 3.1.1: Arrays and Strings
- Chapter 3.2: String Library Functions

## Next Steps

After completing these exercises, continue with:
- Chapter 4: Expressions and Statements
- Chapter 5: Statements
