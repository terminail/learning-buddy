2. **Vector Operations** - Learn advanced vector manipulation techniques
3. **Vector Algorithms** - Apply STL algorithms to solve problems with vectors
4. **List Basics** - Understand different sequential container characteristics
5. **Stack Basics** - Learn container adapter concepts

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Container Types**: vector, list, stack
- **Initialization Methods**: Default, size-based, initializer lists
- **Element Access**: Indexing, iterators, range-based loops
- **Modification Operations**: Insert, erase, push, pop
