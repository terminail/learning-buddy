// Exercise 2.1.1: Variables and Basic Types
// This exercise introduces you to C++ variables and basic data types.
// Your task is to declare and initialize variables of different types.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // TODO: Declare an integer variable named 'age' and initialize it with your age
    // Example approach: Declare an int variable and assign your age to it
    
    // TODO: Declare a double variable named 'height' and initialize it with your height in meters
    // Example approach: Declare a double variable and assign your height to it
    
    // TODO: Declare a char variable named 'grade' and initialize it with your grade (A, B, C, D, or F)
    // Example approach: Declare a char variable and assign a grade letter to it (use single quotes)
    
    // TODO: Declare a bool variable named 'isStudent' and initialize it appropriately
    // Example approach: Declare a bool variable and assign true or false based on whether you're a student
    
    // TODO: Declare a string variable named 'name' and initialize it with your name
    // Note: For strings, you need to include <string> header
    // Example approach: Declare a std::string variable and assign your name to it (use double quotes)
    
    // TODO: Print all variables to the console
    // Example approach: Use std::cout to print each variable with appropriate labels
    
    return 0;
