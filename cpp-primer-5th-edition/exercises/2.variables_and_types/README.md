# Chapter 2.1: Variables and Types

This directory contains exercises for learning about variables and types in C++ as covered in C++ Primer 5th Edition.

## Exercise Structure

### 2.1.1: Variable Declarations
**Directory**: [variable_declarations](variable_declarations/)
Introduction to variable declaration and basic types including int, double, char, bool, and their variants.

### 2.1.2: Variable Initialization
**Directory**: [variable_initialization](variable_initialization/)
Different methods of variable initialization including copy, direct, and list initialization.

### 2.1.3: Constants
**Directory**: [constants](constants/)
Constants and constexpr in C++ including const variables and compile-time constants.

### 2.1.4: Scope and Lifetime
**Directory**: [scope_and_lifetime](scope_and_lifetime/)
Variable scope and lifetime concepts including global, local, and block scope.

## Learning Progression

Complete the exercises in numerical order:
1. [variable_declarations](variable_declarations/) - Fundamental variable declarations
2. [variable_initialization](variable_initialization/) - Variable initialization methods
3. [constants](constants/) - Constants and constexpr
4. [scope_and_lifetime](scope_and_lifetime/) - Variable scope and lifetime

## Getting Started

Each exercise directory contains:
- `src/` - Source code files (exercise and solution)
- `test/` - Unit tests
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Build configuration
- `README.md` - Exercise-specific documentation
- `build.sh` - Build script for Linux/Docker
- `run_tests.sh` - Test execution script

## Prerequisites

These exercises build upon knowledge from:
- Basic computer operations
- Text editor or IDE usage
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

## Next Steps

After completing these exercises, continue with:
- Chapter 2.2: Basic IO Operations
- Chapter 3.1: Arrays and Strings
- Chapter 3.2: String Library Functions
