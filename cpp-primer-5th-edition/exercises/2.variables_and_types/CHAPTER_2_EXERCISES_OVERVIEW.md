# Chapter 2: Variables and Types Exercises Overview

This directory contains exercises for Chapter 2 of C++ Primer 5th Edition, which covers variables and basic types in C++.

## Exercise Progression

### 2.1a: Variable Declarations
**Directory**: [variable_declarations](variable_declarations/)
**Focus**: Introduction to variable declaration and basic types
- Declaring variables of different types (int, double, char, bool)
- Understanding basic data types and their variants
- Variable naming conventions and valid identifiers
- Basic variable scope concepts

### 2.1b: Variable Initialization
**Directory**: [variable_initialization](variable_initialization/)
**Focus**: Different methods of variable initialization
- Copy initialization (= syntax)
- Direct initialization (parentheses syntax)
- List initialization (brace syntax, C++11)
- Default initialization and undefined values

### 2.1c: Constants
**Directory**: [constants](constants/)
**Focus**: Constants and constexpr in C++
- const variables for runtime constants
- constexpr variables for compile-time constants
- Literal constants and their suffixes
- Difference between const and constexpr

### 2.1d: Scope and Lifetime
**Directory**: [scope_and_lifetime](scope_and_lifetime/)
**Focus**: Variable scope and lifetime concepts
- Global, local, and block scope
- Variable lifetime and memory management
- Static variables and their persistence
- Variable shadowing in nested scopes

## Key Concepts Covered

### Variable Fundamentals
- **Declaration vs Definition**: Understanding the difference
- **Data Types**: int, double, char, bool, and their variants
- **Initialization**: Different ways to initialize variables
- **Scope**: Where variables can be accessed

### Basic Types
- **Integral Types**: int, short, long, long long (signed and unsigned)
- **Floating-Point Types**: float, double, long double
- **Character Types**: char, wchar_t
- **Boolean Type**: bool for true/false values

### Initialization Methods
- **Copy Initialization**: int x = 42;
- **Direct Initialization**: int x(42);
- **List Initialization**: int x{42};
- **Default Initialization**: int x;

### Constants and Scope
- **const**: Runtime constants
- **constexpr**: Compile-time constants
- **Literal Constants**: Integer, floating-point, character literals
- **Variable Lifetime**: Stack vs static storage duration
