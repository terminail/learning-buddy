// Exercise 15.1a: Inheritance Basics
// This exercise introduces you to inheritance in C++.
// Your task is to create a base class and derived classes that demonstrate inheritance.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// TODO: Create a base class called Vehicle
// Example approach:
// 1. Define a base class Vehicle with:
//    - Protected member variables for brand and model
//    - A constructor that initializes brand and model
//    - A virtual displayInfo() function

// TODO: Create a derived class called Car
// Example approach:
// 1. Define a Car class that inherits from Vehicle
// 2. Add a member variable for number of doors
// 3. Implement a constructor that calls the base class constructor
// 4. Override the displayInfo() function

// TODO: Create another derived class called Motorcycle
// Example approach:
// 1. Define a Motorcycle class that inherits from Vehicle
// 2. Add a member variable for engine size
// 3. Implement a constructor that calls the base class constructor
// 4. Override the displayInfo() function

int main() {
    // TODO: Create instances of Car and Motorcycle
    // TODO: Call their displayInfo() functions
    
    return 0;
