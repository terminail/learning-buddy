# Chapter 15: Object-Oriented Programming Exercises Overview

This directory contains exercises for Chapter 15 of C++ Primer 5th Edition, which covers object-oriented programming concepts in C++.

## Exercise Progression

### 15.1a: Inheritance Basics
**Directory**: [inheritance_basics](inheritance_basics/)
**Focus**: Introduction to inheritance in C++
- Creating base classes and derived classes
- Accessing base class members from derived classes
- Understanding inheritance access specifiers
- Constructor and destructor behavior in inheritance

### 15.1b: Virtual Functions
**Directory**: [virtual_functions](virtual_functions/)
**Focus**: Virtual functions and polymorphism
- Declaring and implementing virtual functions
- Pure virtual functions and abstract base classes
- Dynamic binding and polymorphism
- Virtual destructors

## Learning Path

Students should complete these exercises in order:
1. **Inheritance Basics** - Start with fundamental inheritance concepts
2. **Virtual Functions** - Learn about virtual functions and polymorphism

## Key Concepts Covered

### Inheritance
- **Base and Derived Classes**: Creating class hierarchies
- **Access Control**: Public, protected, and private inheritance
- **Constructor Chaining**: How constructors are called in inheritance
- **Member Access**: Accessing base class members in derived classes

### Virtual Functions
- **Virtual Dispatch**: Runtime method resolution
- **Pure Virtual Functions**: Creating abstract base classes
- **Polymorphism**: Using base class pointers with derived objects
- **Virtual Destructors**: Ensuring proper cleanup in inheritance hierarchies

## Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with:
- Basic C++ syntax and data types
- Classes and objects
- Member functions and access specifiers
- Constructors and destructors
