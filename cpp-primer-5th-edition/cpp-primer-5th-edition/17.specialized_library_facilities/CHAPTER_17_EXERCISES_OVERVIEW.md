# Chapter 17: Specialized Library Facilities Exercises Overview

This directory contains exercises for Chapter 17 of C++ Primer 5th Edition, which covers specialized library facilities in C++.

## Exercise Progression

### 17.1a: Bitset Operations
**Directory**: [bitset_operations](bitset_operations/)
**Focus**: Bit manipulation with bitsets
- Creating and initializing bitsets
- Performing bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
- Using bitset member functions
- Converting between bitsets and other types

### 17.1b: Random Number Generation
**Directory**: [random_numbers](random_numbers/)
**Focus**: Random number generation facilities
- Creating random number generators
- Using different distributions (uniform, normal, etc.)
- Seeding generators for reproducible results
- Generating random numbers in specific ranges

## Learning Path

Students should complete these exercises in order:
1. **Bitset Operations** - Start with fundamental bit manipulation concepts
2. **Random Number Generation** - Learn about random number generation facilities

## Key Concepts Covered

### Bitset Operations
- **Bitset Creation**: Different ways to create and initialize bitsets
- **Bitwise Operations**: AND, OR, XOR, and NOT operations on bitsets
- **Member Functions**: set(), reset(), flip(), test(), count(), etc.
- **Conversions**: Converting between bitsets and strings/integers
- **Comparison**: Equality and relational operations on bitsets

### Random Number Generation
- **Generators**: Different random number generators (mt19937, etc.)
- **Distributions**: Uniform, normal, and other probability distributions
- **Seeding**: Proper seeding techniques for deterministic testing
- **Range Generation**: Generating numbers within specific ranges
- **Best Practices**: When to use which generator and distribution

## Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with:
- Basic C++ syntax and data types
