// Exercise: Access Control
// This exercise focuses on access specifiers in C++ classes.
// Your task is to work with public, private, and protected members.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// TODO: Define a class with public members
// Example approach:
// 1. Create a class with public data members and member functions
// 2. Understand direct access to public members
// 3. Recognize the lack of data encapsulation

// TODO: Define a class with private members
// Example approach:
// 1. Create a class with private data members
// 2. Implement public getter and setter functions
// 3. Understand data encapsulation and information hiding

// TODO: Define a class with protected members
// Example approach:
// 1. Create a base class with protected members
// 2. Create derived classes that can access protected members
// 3. Understand the difference between private and protected access

// TODO: Work with friend functions and classes
// Example approach:
// 1. Declare friend functions that can access private members
// 2. Declare friend classes that can access private members
// 3. Understand the trade-offs of using friends

int main() {
    // TODO: Create objects and test access control
    // TODO: Experiment with inheritance and access control
    // TODO: Work with friend functions and classes
    
    return 0;
