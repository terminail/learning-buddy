# Chapter 3.1.1: Arrays and Strings

This directory contains exercises for learning about arrays and strings in C++ as covered in C++ Primer 5th Edition.

## Exercise Structure

### 3.1.1a: Array Basics
**Directory**: [array_basics](array_basics/)
Introduction to C-style arrays including declaration, initialization, and basic operations.

### 3.1.1b: String Basics
**Directory**: [string_basics](string_basics/)
Introduction to std::string including declaration, initialization, and basic operations.

### 3.1.1c: Array and String Operations
**Directory**: [array_string_operations](array_string_operations/)
Combining arrays and strings to solve practical problems.

## Learning Progression

Complete the exercises in numerical order:
1. [array_basics](array_basics/) - Fundamental array concepts
2. [string_basics](string_basics/) - std::string operations
3. [array_string_operations](array_string_operations/) - Combined concepts

## Getting Started

Each exercise directory contains:
- `src/` - Source code files (exercise and solution)
- `test/` - Unit tests
- `CMakeLists.txt` - Build configuration
- `README.md` - Exercise-specific documentation
- `build.sh` - Build script for Linux/Docker
- `test_runner.sh` - Test execution script

## Prerequisites

These exercises build upon knowledge from:
- Chapter 2: Variables and Basic Types
- Basic input/output operations

## Next Steps

After completing these exercises, continue with:
- Chapter 3.2: String Library Functions
- Chapter 3.3: Array and String Algorithms
- Chapter 4: Expressions and Statements
