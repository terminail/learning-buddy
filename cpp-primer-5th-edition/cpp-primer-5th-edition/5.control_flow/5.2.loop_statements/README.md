# Exercise 5.1.2: Loop Statements

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to use for loops for counting
- Learn about while loops for condition-based repetition
- Practice using do-while loops for guaranteed execution
- Implement programs that repeat actions efficiently

## Concepts Covered
- For loops
- While loops
- Do-while loops
- Loop control variables
- Loop termination conditions

## Instructions
1. Open `src/loop_statements_exercises.cpp`
2. Follow the TODO comments to implement the three programs
3. Compile and run your program to verify it works correctly
4. Compare your solution with `src/loop_statements_solutions.cpp`

## Expected Output
Example output when running the solution:
```
Numbers from 1 to 10: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 
Enter a number: 5
Sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is: 15
Enter numbers (enter 0 to stop):
Enter a number: 3
You entered: 3
Enter a number: 7
You entered: 7
Enter a number: 0
Program ended.
```

## Key Points to Remember
- **For loop**: Best for counting or when you know the number of iterations
- **While loop**: Best when you continue based on a condition
- **Do-while loop**: Best when you need to execute at least once
- **Loop control variable**: Used to control when the loop starts and stops
- **Infinite loops**: Make sure your loop has a proper termination condition

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Off-by-one errors in loop conditions
- Forgetting to update the loop control variable
- Creating infinite loops by not changing the termination condition
- Using the wrong loop type for the problem

## Next Steps
After completing this exercise, proceed to:
- Exercise 5.1.3: Nested Control Statements
- Exercise 5.1.1: If Statements (review if needed)
