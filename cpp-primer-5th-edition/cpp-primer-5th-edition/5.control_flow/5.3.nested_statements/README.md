# Exercise 5.1.3: Nested Control Statements

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how to nest control statements (loops inside loops, if inside loops, etc.)
- Learn about complex control flow structures
- Practice writing programs with multiple levels of decision making
- Implement algorithms that require nested iterations

## Concepts Covered
- Nested loops
- Nested if statements
- Combination of loops and if statements
- Complex control flow patterns
- Algorithm implementation

## Instructions
1. Open `src/nested_statements_exercises.cpp`
2. Follow the TODO comments to implement the three programs
3. Compile and run your program to verify it works correctly
4. Compare your solution with `src/nested_statements_solutions.cpp`

## Expected Output
Example output when running the solution:
```
Enter number of rows: 5
*
**
***
****
*****

Enter a number: 20
Prime numbers up to 20: 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 

Guess a number between 1 and 10 (you have 5 attempts):
Attempt 1: 3
Too low!
Attempt 2: 8
Too high!
Attempt 3: 7
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.
```

## Key Points to Remember
- **Nested loops**: One loop inside another loop
- **Nested if statements**: One if statement inside another if statement
- **Combination patterns**: Loops containing if statements or vice versa
- **Loop control**: Be careful with loop variables in nested structures
- **Readability**: Use proper indentation to show nesting levels

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Forgetting to properly indent nested structures
- Using the wrong loop variable in inner loops
- Creating infinite loops due to incorrect termination conditions
- Making logic too complex without proper structure

## Next Steps
After completing this exercise, proceed to:
- Review all control flow exercises (5.1.1, 5.1.2, 5.1.3)
- Move on to functions exercises
