// Exercise 5.1.3: Nested Control Statements
// This exercise introduces you to nested control statements in C++.
// Your task is to write programs that combine multiple control structures.

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // TODO: Write a program that prints a right-angled triangle of stars using nested loops
    // Example approach:
    // 1. Use an outer loop to control the number of rows
    // 2. Use an inner loop to control the number of stars in each row
    // 3. The inner loop should iterate from 1 to the current row number
    // 4. After each row, print a newline character
    
    // TODO: Write a program that finds all prime numbers up to n using nested loops and if statements
    // Example approach:
    // 1. Use an outer loop to iterate through numbers from 2 to n
    // 2. For each number, use an inner loop to check for divisors
    // 3. Use an if statement to check if a divisor is found
    // 4. If no divisors are found (other than 1 and the number itself), it's prime
    
    // TODO: Write a program that implements a simple number guessing game using nested control statements
    // Example approach:
    // 1. Generate a random number (you can use a fixed number for this exercise)
    // 2. Use an outer loop to allow multiple guesses
    // 3. Use an inner if/else structure to check if the guess is correct, too high, or too low
    // 4. Use break to exit the loop when the correct number is guessed
    
    return 0;
