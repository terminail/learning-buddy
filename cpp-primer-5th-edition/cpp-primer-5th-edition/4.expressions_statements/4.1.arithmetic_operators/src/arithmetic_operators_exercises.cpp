// Exercise: Arithmetic Operators
// This exercise focuses on arithmetic operators in C++.
// Your task is to work with basic arithmetic operations and understand operator behavior.

#include <iostream>

// TODO: Use basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
// Example approach:
// 1. Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with integers
// 2. Perform division and modulus with different operand types
// 3. Observe the behavior of division with integer operands

// TODO: Work with unary arithmetic operators (+, -)
// Example approach:
// 1. Apply unary plus and minus to variables
// 2. Understand how unary operators affect values

// TODO: Understand arithmetic operator precedence
// Example approach:
// 1. Write expressions with multiple arithmetic operators
// 2. Use parentheses to control evaluation order
// 3. Verify your understanding with test cases

int main() {
    // TODO: Implement arithmetic operations with integers
    // TODO: Implement arithmetic operations with floating-point numbers
    // TODO: Experiment with operator precedence and parentheses
    
    return 0;
