# Exercise: Arithmetic Operators

This exercise focuses on arithmetic operators in C++, including basic operations, unary operators, and operator precedence.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and use basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
- Work with unary arithmetic operators (+, -)
- Learn about operator precedence and associativity
- Practice with mixed-type arithmetic operations

## Building and Running

1. Build the exercise:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   ./run_tests.sh
   ```

## Key Concepts Covered

### Basic Arithmetic Operators
- Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*)
- Division (/) - Integer vs Floating-point behavior
- Modulus (%) - Remainder operator for integers

### Unary Operators
- Unary Plus (+) - No effect on value
- Unary Minus (-) - Negation of value

### Operator Precedence
- Multiplication, Division, and Modulus have higher precedence than Addition and Subtraction
- Parentheses can override natural precedence
- Left-to-right associativity for operators of the same precedence level

## Practice Exercises

1. Implement arithmetic operations with different data types
2. Experiment with operator precedence using complex expressions
3. Work with unary operators in various contexts
4. Understand the behavior of division with integer operands
