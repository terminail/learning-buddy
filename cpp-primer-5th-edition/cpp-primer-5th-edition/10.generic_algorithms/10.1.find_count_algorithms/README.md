# Exercise 10.1a: Find and Count Algorithms

This directory contains exercises for learning about find and count algorithms in C++ STL as covered in C++ Primer 5th Edition.

## Exercise Structure

### Find and Count Algorithms
**Directory**: [src/](src/)

## Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, students will understand:
- How to use std::find to locate elements in containers
- How to use std::count to count occurrences of elements
- How to use std::find_if and std::count_if with predicates
- How to work with these algorithms on different container types
- Best practices for searching and counting in containers

## Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with:
- Basic C++ syntax
- STL containers (vector, list, etc.)
- Iterators
- Lambda expressions
- Basic understanding of templates

## Building and Testing
