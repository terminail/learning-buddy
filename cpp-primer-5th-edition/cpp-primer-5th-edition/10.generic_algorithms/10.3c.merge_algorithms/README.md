This directory contains exercises for learning about merging algorithms in C++ STL as covered in C++ Primer 5th Edition.

## Exercise Structure

### Merge Algorithms
**Directory**: [src/](src/)

## Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, students will understand:
- How to use std::merge to combine two sorted sequences
- How to use std::inplace_merge to merge adjacent sorted sequences
- How to work with merge algorithms and custom comparators
- Performance characteristics of different merging approaches
- Best practices for merging sorted data efficiently

## Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with:
- Basic C++ syntax
- STL containers (vector, etc.)
- Iterators
- Lambda expressions
- Basic understanding of templates
- Sorting algorithms
