# Exercise 10.3b: Advanced Sorting Algorithms

This directory contains exercises for learning about advanced sorting algorithms in C++ STL as covered in C++ Primer 5th Edition.

## Exercise Structure

### Advanced Sorting Algorithms
**Directory**: [src/](src/)

## Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, students will understand:
- How to use std::partial_sort for partial ordering of containers
- How to use std::nth_element for efficient selection algorithms
- Performance characteristics of different sorting approaches
- When to use partial sorting vs. full sorting vs. selection
- Best practices for sorting large datasets efficiently

## Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with:
- Basic C++ syntax
- STL containers (vector, etc.)
- Iterators
- Lambda expressions
- Basic understanding of templates
- Time complexity analysis

## Building and Testing

```bash
# Build the exercise
./build.sh

# Run tests
