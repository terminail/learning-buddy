# Exercise 10.3a: Basic Sorting Algorithms

This directory contains exercises for learning about basic sorting algorithms in C++ STL as covered in C++ Primer 5th Edition.

## Exercise Structure

### Basic Sorting Algorithms
**Directory**: [src/](src/)

## Learning Objectives

By completing these exercises, students will understand:
- How to use std::sort to sort containers in ascending and descending order
- How to use std::stable_sort to maintain relative order of equivalent elements
- How to sort containers of custom objects using lambda expressions
- How to work with different sorting algorithms and their use cases
- Best practices for sorting data in containers

## Prerequisites

Students should be familiar with:
- Basic C++ syntax
- STL containers (vector, list, etc.)
- Iterators
- Lambda expressions
- Basic understanding of templates

## Building and Testing
